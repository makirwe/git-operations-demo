# Git Operations Demo

This repository demonstrates various Git operations using Python. It includes examples of:

- Basic Git operations (init, add, commit)
- Branch management
- Merge conflict resolution
- Remote repository operations

## Examples

### 1. Branch Operations (`branch_operations.py`)
Demonstrates Git branching workflows including:
- Creating branches
- Switching between branches
- Making parallel changes
- Merging branches

### 2. Conflict Resolution (`conflict_resolution.py`)
Shows how to handle merge conflicts:
- Creating conflicting changes
- Detecting conflicts during merge
- Resolving conflicts programmatically

### 3. Remote Operations (`remote_operations.py`)
Demonstrates remote repository management:
- Adding and managing remotes
- Cloning repositories
- Pushing and pulling changes
- Tracking remote branches
- Listing remote branches

## Usage

Each example can be run independently:

```bash
# Run branch operations demo
python branch_operations.py

# Run conflict resolution demo
python conflict_resolution.py

# Run remote operations demo
python remote_operations.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Git installed and configured

## Branch Structure

- `master`: Main branch with stable code
- `branch-demo`: Examples of branching operations
- Additional feature branches for specific examples
